## What are dotfiles?

Dotfiles are configuration files that can be auto-generated *or* custom-made.

For example, `.bash_aliases` is a collection of aliases for bash, like making `la` equivalent to `ls -A`.
This particular alias makes it easier to see hidden files.

## How do I use these?

These dotfiles will *not* work on every system. They'll work on Linux, maybe POSIX, but probably not Windows.

You can copy or download the files you'd like to use. Maybe you just want `.vim/colors/nord.vim`. If so, you can download that file and save it to 
`$HOME/.vim/colors/nord.vim`. 

One file I really love using is `.ps1.sh`. It configures your prompt to make it more informative while not being over-crowded. Plus I made it.

All of these files use the MIT License, so you can copy them without asking or anything. Hope you like them :)
